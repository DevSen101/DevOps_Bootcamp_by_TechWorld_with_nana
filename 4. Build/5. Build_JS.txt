build js file  no special artifact 
there are teo npm and yarn package managers 
both use package.json tomanage their dependencies
itsuse for install dependecies not transpiling code
npm install, start, stop, test and publish
what dows the zar/zip include
app code not the dependencies

run the app n a server
install dep, unpackzip/tar run the appp
copy artiafact ,package json file
in js its more flexible
this is for backend in node


what about package frontend code
it can be possible frontend in reack and backend in py, java, node
it has diff ways to package
either package seprate code or package together
so we have diff package.json for both front end and backend 
or one package,json for whole

but frontend reck code must be transpiled because browser dont understad it doesnt supports latest jsx etcneeds to be compressed
sep build tool webpack for react 

npm runbuild

npm and yarn for dependecies
seprate package.jsonvs common package .json with backend
can be an adv to have same build and package mngmn tol

also frontend in js and backend in java are very common
bundle frontend with webpack, manage dep using npm and yarn
at the last whole sum u make a war file
