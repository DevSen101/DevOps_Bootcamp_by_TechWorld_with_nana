build tools in docker
no need to build and move diff artifact(jar, war)
just one artifact type docker image
we build those docker image from the application
no need for a repo for each type
just one for docker img
no need to iunstall dep on the server
execute install cmd in docker img
docker make it easier to cosolidete
d image is artifact 
its a alternative for all the artifact
we dont need to instal npm and java on the server execute everything in image

but instead we need to build our js or java then we make docker image from the build
