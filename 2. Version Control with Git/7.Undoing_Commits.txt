### Undoing & Changing Commits (reset, revert, amend)

These commands are used to **fix mistakes safely** depending on whether commits are **local or already pushed**.

---

## 1. `git reset` (Move HEAD backward)

**Use when:** Commit is **local** and NOT pushed.

### Soft reset (keep changes staged)

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

👉 Removes last commit, keeps changes ready to recommit.

### Mixed reset (default – keep changes unstaged)

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

👉 Removes commit, keeps code but unstaged.

### Hard reset (danger ⚠️)

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

👉 Deletes commit **and code changes** permanently.

**One-liner:** Reset rewrites history (local only).

---

## 2. `git commit --amend` (Edit Last Commit)

**Use when:** Fix message or add missed files to **latest commit**.

Add forgotten file:

```bash
git add file.js
git commit --amend
```

Change commit message only:

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Fix login validation bug"
```

👉 Replaces last commit with a new one.

**Rule:**
❌ Don’t amend commits already pushed (unless force push).

---

## 3. `git revert` (Safe Undo)

**Use when:** Commit is **already pushed**.

```bash
git revert <commit-id>
```

👉 Creates a **new commit** that reverses changes.

**Why safe?**

* History is preserved
* Team-friendly

**One-liner:** Revert undoes changes without rewriting history.

### Reset vs Revert (Interview Gold)

| Command | Changes History | Safe for Remote |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| reset   | Yes             | ❌ No            |
| revert  | No              | ✅ Yes           |

---

## Merging Branches (Bugfix → main/master)

**Purpose:** Combine completed work into main codebase.

### Step-by-Step Merge

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Merge bugfix branch:

```bash
git merge bugfix-auth
```

👉 Creates a merge commit (if needed).

### Push Merged Code

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

### After Merge (Cleanup)

```bash
git branch -d bugfix-auth
git push origin --delete bugfix-auth
```

---

### One-Line Summaries (Notes)

* **reset** → undo local commits by moving HEAD
* **amend** → modify last commit
* **revert** → safely undo pushed commits
* **merge** → combine branch changes into main

### Interview Tip (1 Line)

> Use reset/amend for local fixes, revert for shared history, and merge to integrate feature or bugfix branches.
