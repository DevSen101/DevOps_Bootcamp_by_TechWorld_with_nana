### Deleting Branches (Local & Remote)

**Purpose:** Clean up branches after work is merged.

#### Delete Local Branch

```bash
git branch -d feature-login
```

👉 Deletes branch **only if merged**.

Force delete (not merged):

```bash
git branch -D feature-login
```

#### Delete Remote Branch

```bash
git push origin --delete feature-login
```

👉 Removes branch from GitHub/GitLab.

**Verify**

```bash
git branch -a
```

**Best Practice:** Delete feature branches after merge to keep repo clean.

## Avoiding Merge Commits (Rebase)

**Problem:** Merge creates extra “merge commits” → messy history.
**Solution:** **Rebase** replays your commits on top of latest `main` → clean, linear history.

#### Rebase Feature Branch on `main`

```bash
git checkout feature-login
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

👉 Your commits are moved on top of latest `main`.

#### Push After Rebase

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

👉 Required because commit history changed (safe force).

**Rule:**
✔ Rebase **your own feature branches**
❌ Never rebase shared `main` / `develop`

**One-liner:** Rebase avoids merge commits by keeping history linear.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

**When it happens:** Same lines edited in different branches.

#### Conflict Example

```txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log("Main branch code");
=======
console.log("Feature branch code");
>>>>>>> feature-login
```

#### Steps to Resolve

1. Open the conflicted file
2. Choose correct code (or combine)
3. Remove conflict markers
4. Mark resolved:

```bash
git add filename
```

#### Continue Rebase / Merge

* During rebase:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

* During merge:

```bash
git commit
```

**Abort if needed**

```bash
git rebase --abort
git merge --abort
```

### One-Line Summaries (Notes)

* **Deleting branches:** Removes unused branches locally and remotely after merge.
* **Rebase:** Rewrites commit history to avoid merge commits and keep it clean.
* **Merge conflict:** Happens when Git can’t auto-merge; resolve manually and continue.

### Interview Tip (Quick)

> Rebase keeps history clean, merge preserves history; conflicts are resolved by manually choosing correct changes.
