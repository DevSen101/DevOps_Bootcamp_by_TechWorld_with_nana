### Concept of Branches (Short, Practical Explanation)

A **branch** in Git is an **independent line of development**.
It lets you work on new features or fixes **without affecting the main code**.

Think of it like:

> Copy of `main` → work safely → merge when ready

---

### Why Branches are Used (Real Example)

* `main` → production-ready code
* `feature/login` → login feature in progress
* `bugfix/auth-error` → fixing an issue

👉 Multiple developers can work **in parallel** without conflicts.

---

### Create a Branch Locally (Demo)

Check current branch:

```bash
git branch
```

Create a new branch:

```bash
git branch feature-login
```

Switch to the branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-login
```

OR (modern way):

```bash
git switch feature-login
```

👉 Now all changes are isolated in this branch.

---

### Create & Switch in One Command

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

👉 Creates + switches to branch at once.

---

### Push Branch to Remote (Create Remote Branch)

```bash
git push -u origin feature-login
```

👉 This creates the **same branch on GitHub/GitLab** and links it.

---

### Verify Remote Branch

```bash
git branch -a
```

👉 Shows local + remote branches.

---

### Typical Branch Workflow (DevOps Style)

1. Create branch
2. Write code
3. Commit changes
4. Push branch
5. Create Pull Request / Merge Request
6. Merge into `main`

---

### One-Line Summary (For Notes)

> A Git branch is an isolated workspace used to develop features or fixes safely, which can later be merged into the main branch.

---

### Interview Tip (1-liner)

> Branching enables parallel development and protects the stability of production code.
