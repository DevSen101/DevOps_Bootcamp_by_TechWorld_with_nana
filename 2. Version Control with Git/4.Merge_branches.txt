### Merge Requests (Short, Practical Explanation)

A **Merge Request (MR)** (called **Pull Request** in GitHub) is a request to **merge one branch into another**, usually into `main`.

It is used for:

* **Code review**
* **Quality checks**
* **Safe merging**

---

### Why Merge Requests are Important (Real DevOps Use)

* Prevents broken code from reaching production
* Enables **peer review**
* Triggers **CI/CD pipelines**
* Keeps `main` branch stable

---

### Practical Flow of a Merge Request

#### 1. Work on a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

Make changes, then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add login feature"
git push -u origin feature-login
```

---

#### 2. Create Merge Request (GitHub / GitLab UI)

* **Source branch:** `feature-login`
* **Target branch:** `main`
* Add title & description
* Assign reviewer (optional)
* Click **Create Merge Request**

👉 This tells the team: *“Please review and merge my code.”*

---

#### 3. Review & Merge

Options:

* **Approve** → code looks good
* **Request changes** → fix issues
* **Merge** → code becomes part of `main`

---

### Merge Strategies (Simple)

* **Merge commit** → keeps full history
* **Squash merge** → combines commits into one
* **Rebase & merge** → clean linear history

---

### After Merge (Cleanup)

Delete feature branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature-login
git push origin --delete feature-login
```

👉 Keeps repo clean.

### One-Line Summary (For Notes)

> A Merge Request is a formal process to review, test, and merge code from one branch into another safely.

---

### Interview 1-Liner

> Merge Requests ensure code quality by enabling review, testing, and controlled integration into the main branch.
