### Git for DevOps (Short, Practical Explanation)

**Git in DevOps** is the **single source of truth** for code, configs, and automation that trigger **CI/CD pipelines** and production deployments.

👉 In DevOps: **Every change starts with a Git commit**.

---

## Why Git is Critical in DevOps (Real Use)

* Stores **application code**
* Stores **infrastructure code** (Terraform, Helm, YAML)
* Triggers **CI/CD pipelines**
* Enables **rollback & audit**
* Supports **collaboration at scale**

---

## Typical DevOps Git Workflow

### 1. Developer Pushes Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Dockerfile"
git push origin feature-docker
```

👉 Push triggers CI pipeline automatically.

---

### 2. CI Pipeline Runs (Auto)

* Build app
* Run tests
* Security scan
* Create artifact (Docker image)

📌 All triggered by **Git commit / merge request**.

---

### 3. Merge Request → Main

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-docker
git push origin main
```

👉 Merge triggers **CD pipeline** → deploy to staging/production.

---

## Git with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Example files tracked in Git:

```text
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
terraform/
k8s-deployment.yaml
.github/workflows/
.gitlab-ci.yml
```

👉 Infra changes are **versioned, reviewed, and auditable**.

---

## Branching Strategy (DevOps Friendly)

* `main` → production
* `develop` → integration
* `feature/*` → development
* `hotfix/*` → urgent prod fixes

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b hotfix-memory-leak
```

---

## Git as Automation Trigger

| Git Action    | DevOps Result  |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Commit        | CI starts      |
| Merge Request | Tests + review |
| Merge to main | Deployment     |
| Tag           | Release        |

Create release tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## Rollback Using Git (Production Save)

```bash
git revert <bad-commit-id>
git push origin main
```

👉 Pipeline redeploys stable version.

---

## DevOps Best Practices with Git

* Small, frequent commits
* Meaningful commit messages
* Mandatory Merge Requests
* Protected `main` branch
* `.gitignore` properly configured
* Never commit secrets

---

### One-Line Summary (Notes)

> In DevOps, Git acts as the backbone for CI/CD, infrastructure versioning, automation triggers, and safe production rollbacks.

---

### Interview 2-Liner

> Git enables DevOps by providing version control, collaboration, and automation triggers for CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code.
