### **DevOps – Concise Notes**

#### **What is DevOps**

* DevOps = **Development + Operations**
* A culture and practice to **build, test, release, and deploy software faster and reliably**
* Focuses on **automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery**

**Goal**

* Faster releases
* Fewer failures
* Quick recovery

---

### **Dev (Development)**

* Writes code
* Builds features
* Fixes bugs
* Uses tools like Git, IDEs, frameworks

---

### **Ops (Operations)**

* Manages servers & infrastructure
* Deploys applications
* Monitoring & security
* Uses tools like Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS

---

### **Why DevOps Came**

* Dev and Ops worked separately
* Dev wanted speed
* Ops wanted stability
* DevOps **removes silos** and shares responsibility

---

### **DevOps Lifecycle**

* Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Monitor → Improve

---

### **CI/CD**

* **CI (Continuous Integration)**
  Code is tested automatically after every change
* **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**
  Code is deployed automatically

---

## **Software Development Models**

### **Waterfall Model**

* Linear and sequential
* One phase must finish before the next starts

**Flow**

* Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment

**Pros**

* Simple
* Good for fixed requirements

**Cons**

* No flexibility
* Late feedback
* Not suitable for fast changes

---

### **Agile Model**

* Iterative and incremental
* Work done in small cycles (**sprints**)

**Key Ideas**

* Customer collaboration
* Fast feedback
* Continuous improvement

**Pros**

* Flexible
* Early delivery
* Better quality

**Cons**

* Needs strong communication
* Less documentation

---

### **Agile + DevOps**

* Agile = **how software is built**
* DevOps = **how software is delivered & operated**
* Together they enable **fast + reliable software**

### **Agile vs Waterfall (Quick Compare)**

| Feature         | Agile              | Waterfall |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Flexibility     | High               | Low       |
| Delivery        | Frequent           | One-time  |
| Feedback        | Early & continuous | Late      |
| DevOps Friendly | Yes                | No        |
