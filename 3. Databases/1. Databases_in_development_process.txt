# Databases in the Development Process

## 1. What is a Database?

A **database** is a structured place to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

Examples:

* User details
* Orders, payments
* Logs, analytics
* Application state

---

## 2. Role of Databases in Software Development

### a) During Application Development

Databases are used to:

* Store application data
* Maintain relationships between entities
* Ensure data consistency and integrity

**Example:**

* E-commerce app

  * Users table
  * Products table
  * Orders table

---

### b) Database Design Phase

Key tasks:

* Identify entities (User, Product, Order)
* Define relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
* Normalize data (avoid redundancy)
* Choose primary & foreign keys

---

### c) Development Environments

Different databases for different stages:

| Environment | Purpose                |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Local       | Developer testing      |
| Development | Feature building       |
| Staging     | Pre-production testing |
| Production  | Live users             |

## 3. Types of Databases Used in Development

### a) Relational Databases (SQL)

* Structured schema
* Tables, rows, columns
* ACID properties

Examples:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* SQL Server

Used when:

* Strong consistency needed
* Financial systems
* ERP, banking apps

---

### b) NoSQL Databases

* Flexible schema
* High scalability

Types:

* Document: MongoDB
* Key-Value: Redis
* Column: Cassandra
* Graph: Neo4j

Used when:

* High traffic
* Dynamic schema
* Real-time apps

---

## 4. Database Operations in Development

Common operations (CRUD):

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

Developers work with:

* ORM (Mongoose, Sequelize, Hibernate)
* Raw SQL queries
* Migrations (schema changes)

---

## 5. Database Security in Development

* Input validation
* SQL Injection prevention
* Authentication & authorization
* Encrypted passwords
* Role-based access control

---

# Databases in DevOps Workflow

## 1. Role of Databases in DevOps

In DevOps, databases must be:

* Automated
* Version controlled
* Secure
* Highly available

DevOps focuses on:

* Stability
* Performance
* Zero downtime

---

## 2. Database Provisioning

DevOps automates database creation using:

* Terraform
* CloudFormation
* ARM templates

Provisioning includes:

* DB instance
* Storage
* Network
* Security rules

---

## 3. Database CI/CD

### a) Schema Versioning

* Database changes tracked like code
* Migration scripts stored in Git

Tools:

* Flyway
* Liquibase
* Prisma Migrate

---

### b) Automated Migrations

* Applied during deployment
* No manual DB changes
* Rollback support

---

## 4. Databases in Containers (Docker)

Challenges:

* Data persistence
* Volume management

Solutions:

* Docker volumes
* External managed databases

Example:

* App in Docker
* Database on RDS / Cloud SQL

---

## 5. Databases in Kubernetes

Key concepts:

* StatefulSets
* Persistent Volumes (PV)
* Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

Common practice:

* Stateful apps managed carefully
* Production DBs usually **managed services**

---

## 6. Backup and Recovery

DevOps ensures:

* Automated backups
* Point-in-time recovery
* Disaster recovery plans

Backup types:

* Full backup
* Incremental backup
* Snapshot backups

---

## 7. Monitoring and Performance

Monitored metrics:

* CPU usage
* Memory
* Disk I/O
* Query latency
* Connection count

Tools:

* Prometheus
* Grafana
* CloudWatch
* Datadog

---

## 8. Database Security in DevOps

Key practices:

* Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
* Encrypted storage
* Encrypted connections (TLS)
* Network isolation
* Least privilege access

---

## 9. High Availability & Scaling

### a) Replication

* Master-Slave
* Primary-Replica

### b) Scaling

* Vertical scaling (increase resources)
* Horizontal scaling (read replicas)

---

## 10. Managed Databases in DevOps

Why DevOps prefers managed DBs:

* Automatic patching
* Built-in backups
* High availability

Examples:

* AWS RDS
* AWS DynamoDB
* Google Cloud SQL
* Azure SQL Database

---

# Summary

* **Development** focuses on data modeling, CRUD, and application logic.
* **DevOps** focuses on automation, reliability, security, and scalability.
* Databases are treated as **critical infrastructure**, not just storage.
